# PyCartridge

## Summary:
PyCartridge allows users to run code which would normally fail due to a dependency conflict. 
When two code sources need to cooperate, but cannot do so due to conflicting requirements for each piece of code, 
this is referred to as a dependency conflict. The usual methods for resolving this issue involve
refactoring the entire code base, or throwing out one of the libraries altogether. When time and resources are scarce,
a quick solution is called for. PyCartridge allows users to swap and install packages and their versions on the fly,
and even configure a whole environment specific to certain code blocks only.


# Notes:
- This library requires a CPython distribution for all functions to work.
